# obs-discord-streamkit-overlay-mod

This is not my css. Someone else on github wrote this however for the life of me i cant find the repo anymore so
i wanted to save this for me and anyone else wanting to use the discord streamkit with obs and make it look a little bit better.

This link is a preview to how this looks. the backdrop is my own background but the rest is how it just looks
